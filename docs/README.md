## Project Overview

The Adaptive SM-2 Scheduler is a research implementation of the SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm optimized for Braille literacy learning through IoT tactile flashcards.

### Current Status
- **Phase 1**: SM-2 baseline implementation (COMPLETE)
- **Phase 4**: SSP-MMC-Plus evaluation framework (IN PROGRESS)
- **Architecture**: Professional, scalable structure ready for all research phases
